Windows is a priority because we don't have similar services like CloudApp already.\r\n\r\nWhile in development it wont work with the Dropbox API unless you make your own app and authorise it with a new API key, but feel free to experiment with it anyway.","tagline":"Two-step sharing for every kind of data","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
